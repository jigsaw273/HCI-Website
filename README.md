I created this website in 2020 as a digital tech project. It used HTML/CSS and Javascript
This website is gives an overview of HCI concepts which we had to learn for our Level 1 Digital Tech exam, and I found that at the time there weren't any great resources especially for testing your knowledge so I created this website. 

At the time I preparing to get my learners license and drew inspiration from the buttons on the [drive.govt](https://drive.govt.nz/) website.

- Uses JS for the button animations, and to run the practice quiz. 
- Uses flexbox on the home page.
- Used undraw for the illustraions.
