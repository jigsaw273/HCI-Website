I created this website in 2021 as a passion project. It used HTML/CSS and Javascript
This website is gives an overview of HCI concepts which we had to learn for our Level 1 Digital Tech exam, and I found that at the time there weren't any great resources especially for testing your knowledge so I created this website.
